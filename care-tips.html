        <section id="care-tips">


            <p>Plant care isn’t always the easiest when you’re unsure of where to start. Once you learn plant care
                basics and find a routine, you’ll notice all the wonderful benefits of being a plant parent. Research
                has shown that plants can help you breathe happier and boost your mood just by having them around.
                Whether you’re decking out your room or office with houseplants, we’ve highlighted some top plant care
                tips to assist you in taking care of your new plant babies. Following these plant care instructions will
                come to you as second nature very soon!</p>
            <h2>Feel the Soil to Know How Often to Water Your Plants</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img1.jpg">
            <p>For potted plants at home, you may be unsure of how often to water them. For most plants, the golden rule
                is to see if the first inch or so of soil is dry. If dry, this is an indication that the plant needs
                water. If there are leaves that have shriveled or are dry/discolored, the plant might need a little
                extra water than a regular routine. </p>
            <h2> It’s Better to Underwater Your Plants Than Overwater Them</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img2.jpg">
            <p>A plant can recover faster from being deprived of water than one given excess water. To rescue an
                overwatered plant, you may need to repot the plant and remove any unhealthy roots and overwatered soil
                before moving the plant into a new pot.</p>
            <h2> Skip Fertilization for Houseplants if You’re Unsure</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img3.jpg">
            <p>Houseplants don’t require fertilization unless they are struggling to grow. If you’re unsure of how much
                or what type of fertilization to use when planting, it’s better to skip that step altogether. Too much
                fertilization may actually end up killing your plant rather than helping it.</p>
            <h2> Houseplants Love Stability </h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img4.jpg">
            <p>We recommend scoping out where you’ll put your plant in your house before picking one out. Plants thrive
                once they are used to their surroundings and finding a spot with the right amount of light is important.
                Temperature is also important. Fluctuating temperatures will shock your plant and therefore lead to the
                plant not being able to develop and maybe even die. Most plants prefer temperatures of 65º–75ºF.</p>
            <h2> Smaller Plants Are the Fastest Growing Plants</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img5.jpg">
            <p>When buying your chosen plant, it’s always better to purchase a smaller plant over a larger one. This is
                because a smaller plant will be able to get more established in its home and have a larger ratio of
                roots to top growth. A larger plant will not continue to grow until its roots catch up with the top
                growth.</p>
            <h2> Water Deeply, Rather Than Lightly and Frequently</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img6.jpg">
            <p>When you water lightly and frequently, only the top roots are able to drink the water, and your plant may
                not receive the fuel it needs to survive. Watering deeply, which entails watering your plants heavily
                with water, allows for all the roots to grab a drink. To avoid overwatering, slowly water your plant and
                watch for when the water is not draining through the soil anymore. Once you notice this, stop there.</p>
            <h2> Prune Your Plants</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img7.jpg">
            <p>Getting rid of old-growth on your plants will help your plants grow again. This is kind of like how
                trimming the dead ends of your hair will help your hair grow again. After winter is when you’ll see some
                of the tips or leaves of your plant dying, so a simple plant haircut will do!</p>
            <h2> Try Out a DIY Self-Watering Planter</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img8.jpg">
            <p>Hiring a plant sitter may be difficult if you’re crunched for time or budget, but don’t fear for your
                plants’ lives — there are many ways to water your plants while you’re away. Some methods include
                recycling glass and plastic bottles or creating your own drip system. To learn how to craft these DIY
                self-watering methods, follow our guide on watering your plants while away.</p>
            <h2> Don’t Repot Your Plants by Pulling Them!</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img9.jpg">
            <p>Pulling a plant out will not only ruin the stems, leaves, and blossoms but will also tear roots. Damaged
                roots need to heal before they can fully take in nutrients, so pulling your plant out of its pot is
                never a good plan. Check out our guide on repotting a plant to guarantee no damage to your plant.</p>
            <h2> Dust Your Plants!</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/img10.jpg">
            <p>Plants that collect too much dust on their leaves can’t get the sunlight they may need to survive,
                especially green plants and plants with big leaves. A few times per year, use a wet cloth and lightly
                wipe down the leaves of your plants on both sides.</p>
